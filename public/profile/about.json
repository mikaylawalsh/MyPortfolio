    "about": "I am a computer science student at Brown University graduating in May 2025. Through my CS program, I am pursuing pathways in AI/ML and security. I am proficient in Python, Java, and C (but my favorite is Python!). I also have experience working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ARM/x86 Assembly. Outside of the classroom, you can find me on the field hockey field with my team, in the gym, or in the kitchen cooking (and more realistically, tasting the food)! I also have a golden doodle puppy named Bentley back home in New Jersey.",
